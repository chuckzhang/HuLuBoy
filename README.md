A debug tools mod from demonsters for flash/flex actionscript 3 both in web and air.

Make sure you have Air 3.x to compiler the project , which comes along with flex sdk 4.6.

Install the package HuluBoy.air. First open the tools, then open or reload the swf file you want to debug, the debugger will connect to the swf. Make sure you have swf run in a debug flash player.

The tool can work in win and mac.

some project can't be debuged direcly by this tools, but you can include the swc into your project to avoid that.
