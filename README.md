A debug tools mod from demonsters for flash/flex both in web and air.

Install the package HuluBoy.air in HuLuBoy. First open the tools, then open or reload the swf file you want to debug, the debugger will connect to the swf. Make sure you have swf run in a debug flash player.

The tool can work in win and mac, but is only tested in mac...
